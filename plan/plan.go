/*
PDIEntryCrypt is the public "wire" format for PDI entrues.  It is what it sent to/from communuity data store implementations,
such as Ethereum and NEM.

A PDI entry has two encrypted segements, its header and body segment.  The PDIEntryCrypt.Header is encrypted using a community-public key,
specified by PDIEntryCrypt.CommunityKeyID.  This ensures non-community members (i.e. public snoops) can't see any entry params,
data, or even to what community channel the entry is being post to.  PDIEntryCrypt.Body is encrypted by the same community key as the header *or*
by the key specified via PDIEntryHeader.Author and PDIEntry.AccessChannelID (all via the client's Secure Key Interface).  In sum,
PDIEntry.AccessChannelID specifies a decryption flow through the user's private, compartmentalized keychain.

When a PLAN client starts a new session with a pnode, the client sends the community keys for the session.  This allows
pnode to process and decrypt incoming PDIEntryCrypt entries from the storage medium (e.g. Ethereum).  Otherwise, pnode
has no ability to decrypt PDIEntryCrypt.Header.  A pnode could be configured to keep the communty keychain even when there
are no open client PLAN sessions so that incomning entries can be processed.  Otherwise, incoming entries won't be processed
from the lowest level PDI storage layer.  Both configurations are reasonable depending on security preferences.

When a community admin initiates a community-key "rekey event", the newly generated community key is securely and individually
"sent" to each community member via the community's public key transfer channel. The new community key is encrypted using each member's public key.
When a pnode is processing an entry that it does not have a community key for, it will check the community's public key channel
for an entry for the current client's public key, it will send the client the encrypted community key.  The client uses its SKI
to decrypt the payload into the new community key.  This key is added to the user's SKI keychain and is sent back to pnode.

When pnode sends a PLAN client is PDI entries, it sends PDIEntry.Header (via json) and PDIEntryCrypt.Body.  If the

Recall that the pnode client has no abilty to decrypt PDIEntryCrypt.Body if PDIEntryHeader.AccessChannelID isn't set for
